What you need: Carbide 2.7, S60 SDKs (I am building with 3rd Edition MR, 3rd Edition FP2 V1.1, 5th Edition, v1.0.1).
In addition to that you will need the plug-ins packs for all these. From these, you need to install:
-from 3rd edition: AudioMetaDataReader and SWInstallerLauncher. When compiling, the compiler will complain about missing mmfcontrollerframework.something. Just copy the corresponding files from the 3rd Edition FP2 SDK.
-from 3rd edition FP2: 

What you need to do:
-in this folder there is a subfolder called "epoc32", containing 3 other subfolders. In each of these subfolders there is a header file called fll_sdk_version.h. Copy the fll_sdk_version.h corresponding to each SDK version to the epoc32/include folder of the SDK.
-import the bld.inf into Carbide and create a new project. You can choose to build for all the SDKs mentioned above, or just some of them.

To create the MLauncher.sis file, containing all the binaries for S60 3rd edition and its feature packs, and 5th edition: build the "phone release" configurations for all the SDKs mentioned above. Then run the "makesis.bat" file from the sis folder (you can run it from the command line).
This is it. Enjoy!
