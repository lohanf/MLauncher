   The User-Agent string: MLauncher V x.y
2. Parse the incomming xml file
3. If version is higher, ask the user for upgrade and download
4. If no sis file present, ask the user for download
5. If user approves, download the file to c:\private\E388D98A\MLauncher.sisx
6. If upgrade, launch the Installer (does it work from that folder??)
