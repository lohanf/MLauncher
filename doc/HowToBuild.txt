What you need: Carbide 2.x, S60 SDKs (I am building with 3rd Edition MR, 3rd Edition FP2 V1.1, 5th Edition, v1.0)

What you need to do:
-in this folder there is a subfolder called "epoc32", containing 3 other subfolders. In each of these subfolders there is a header file called fll_sdk_version.h. Copy the fll_sdk_version.h corresponding to each SDK version to the epoc32/include folder of the SDK.
-import the bld.inf into Carbide and create a new project. You can choose to build for all the SDKs mentioned above, or just some of them.

To create the MLauncher.sis file, containing all the binaries for S60 3rd edition and its feature packs, and 5th edition: build the "phone release" configurations for all the SDKs mentioned above. Then run the "makesis.bat" file from the sis folder (you can run it from the command line).
This is it. Enjoy!
